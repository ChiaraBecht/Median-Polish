Median-Polish
=============

   Python implementation of Median Polish algorithm for robust exploratory analysis of the data tables.
The method was proposed by the John Tukey. Method usually applied to two-way tables, it fits an additive model
(constant + rows + columns) to data by considering row and column labels as categorical factors. 

   This repository contains code  and data of two examples of using median polish algorithm. The results were 
validated to comply with sources.

   Add version of fitting model by average as alternative to fitting by median. This is equivalent to ANOVA analysis. By comparison results of applying both approximations to the same data we can clear view advantage of using Median Polish.
